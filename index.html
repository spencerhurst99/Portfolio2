    <!--A little bit about me explaining my passions and dreams that I hope to accomplish-->

                <p>After graduating from highschool I decided to go to school to learn web development, I think its an amazing route to go to find different jobs, opprotunities
                and meet tons of interesting people. Something about web developt that I love is the freedom do work from wherever you are in the world. It opens up life for so many different adventures.
                </p> 
                <p>I hope to improve my skills and build up an impressive portfolio with the skills I learn in these upcoming months!!</p>
                <p>I absolutely love the creativity that goes into web desvelopment, theres so many different ways to make unique, and expressive websites</p>
                <p>I hope to soon meet other developers that share my passion!</p>
