<h2>About Spencer</h2>
<div class = "partTwo"></div>
<p>After graduating from highschool I decided to go to school to learn web development, I think its an amazing route to go to find different jobs, opprotunities
    and meet tons of interesting people. Something about web developt that I love is the freedom do work from wherever you are in the world. It opens up life for so many different adventures.
</p> 
<p>I hope to improve my skills and build up an impressive portfolio with the skills I learn in these upcoming months!!</p>
